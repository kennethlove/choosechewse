                    <p>I really enjoyed our chat on Friday. So much so, in fact, that I kept thinking about it all weekend (obviously, since I made this, huh?). If something gets into my head this much, it's hard to give up.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, I think we need to talk again. We need to talk, seriously, about how we can get ourselves aligned and working together. I know you're hestitant to do remote workers, and, honestly, I'm hesitant to do a full time job again.</p>
                    <p>I think we can make it work, though.</p>
                    <p>So, first, I have a bunch of links for you from companies, much like your own, that do remote workers.</p>

                    <h3 class="fit">Then, I have an offer.</h3>
                    <p>We'll both be at PyCon. Let's work together, remotely, until then. You'll pay my hourly rate and I'll, well, work. At PyCon, we can discuss anything that has come up and, hopefully, our future, together over a couple of whiskys.</p>
